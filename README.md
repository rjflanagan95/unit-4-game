Crystal Collecting Game

Try to make your score match the goal by clicking the crystals. Each crystal has a randomly generated value between 1 and 12, and the goal is a randomly generated number between 19 and 120. Each time the game resets after a win or loss, the result is added to the counter, a new goal is set, and the values of the crystals change.
